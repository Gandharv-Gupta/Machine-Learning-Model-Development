Includes:-Model Development-model training,SimpleLinearRegression,MultipleLinearRegression,evaluation regression plot
,rsidual plot and distribution plot,Polynamial Regression,evaluatio using MeanSquaredError and R^2

NOTE-inclued in-sample evaluations

Conclusion: We will finally be able to develop ML model using relevant regression algo
